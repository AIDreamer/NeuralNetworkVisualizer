# Neural network visualizer

This project serves to visualize activities within a NEAT-based neural network.

In order to run this library, you will need Processing 3 Core set as an external libraries.

## Features

The software allows you to constructs visuals of neural networks layer by layers.

Simply specify different layers and the weights connecting them.

There will also be specific drawer that you can extend. These include:
* Parallel drawer
* Perspective drawer

This library will also be contributed everyday.
